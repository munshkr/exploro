Exploro
=======

**Exploro** is an experimental NLP analyzer with PoS tagging and Named-Entity
Recognition and Classification for documents.  It aims to be easy to use, and
it is focused on exploration of documents.

This project is also a *testbed* for [Analice.me /
Mapa76](https://github.com/hhba/mapa76) as we work towards an easily
installable and more efficient infrastructure.

Inspired by [OpenRefine](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine) and
[Tabula](https://github.com/jazzido/tabula).
